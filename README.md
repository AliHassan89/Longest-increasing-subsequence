#Question description:

Task: Longest increasing subsequence
Given a list of N integers find the longest increasing subsequence in this list.

Example

If the list is [16, 3, 5, 19, 10, 14, 12, 0, 15] one possible answer is the 
subsequence [3, 5, 10, 12, 15], another is [3, 5, 10, 14, 15].

If the list has only one integer, for example: [14], the correct answer is [14].

One more example: [10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0], a possible correct answer is [8].
